Deep reinforcement learning is the combination of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning.
This field of research has been able to solve a wide range of complex decision making tasks that were previously out of reach for a machine.
Thus, deep RL opens up many new applications in domains such as healthcare, robotics, smart grids, finance, and many more. ------ Vincent François-Lavet, Peter Henderson, Riashat Islam, Marc G.

DOI: 10.1561/2200000071.

Since there is no RL or DRL course provided at our university right now,
I suggest we could start deep reinforcement learning seminar (or course if there is an appropriate teacher) next semester.
I could serve as leading organizer for seminar meetings and martials
if a certain number of participators are self-motivated and have passion on this topic.
 
There are a lot of resources and courses we can refer.
