### Surveys

> Deep reinforcement learning is the combination of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning.
> This field of research has been able to solve a wide range of complex decision making tasks that were previously out of reach for a machine.
> Thus, deep RL opens up many new applications in domains such as healthcare, robotics, smart grids, finance, and many more.

Another recent survey [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06339) by Yuxi Li Under review for Morgan & Claypool: Synthesis Lectures in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
draw a comprehensive blueprint on modern (Deep) Reinforcement Learning.
