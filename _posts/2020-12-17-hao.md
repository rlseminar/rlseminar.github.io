Short abstract: Introduce information-directed samplingâ€”a new approach to online optimization
problems in which a decision maker must balance between exploration and exploitation
while learning from partial feedback. Each action is sampled in a manner that
minimizes the ratio between squared expected single-period regret and a measure of information
gain: the mutual information between the optimal action and the next observation.
The expected regret bound for information-directed sampling that applies
across a very general class of models and scales with the entropy of the optimal action
distribution is established.  We Illustrate through simple analytic examples how information-directed
sampling accounts for kinds of information that alternative approaches do not adequately
address and that this can lead to dramatic performance gains. For the widely studied
Bernoulli, Gaussian, and linear bandit problems, we demonstrate state-of-the-art simulation
performance.
