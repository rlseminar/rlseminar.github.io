Short abstract: we will discuss about some necessary and sufficient conditions for the fundamental limits of offline/batch reinforcement learning.

Main reference:
1) What are the Statistical Limits of Offline RL with Linear Function Approximation
2) A Variant of the Wang-Foster-Kakade Lower Bound for the Discounted Setting
